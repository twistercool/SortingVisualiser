# SortingVisualiser
Electron application to visualise the sorting of a random array
To install, you have to have npm and nodejs:
-First, clone the repo into any directory
-Secondly, install the dependencies by running npm install (it'll install chart.js and electron)

Anytime you want to run it, simple go to the directory and type npm start.

I might deploy it as a website in the future, but chart,js is really not made for that, and I'd start the code from scratch, as it's very unoptimised performance-wise.

Currently, I have implemented the visualisation of selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort and stalin sort (destroys the elements that are unsorted).
